# Top-100-Spotify-Tracks-2018
At the end of each year, Spotify compiles a playlist of the songs streamed most often over the course of that year. This year's playlist (Top Tracks of 2018) includes 100 songs. 
There is one .csv file in the dataset. (top2018.csv) This file includes:
Spotify URI for the song
Name of the song
Artist(s) of the song
Audio features for the song (such as danceability, tempo, key etc.)
A more detailed explanation of the audio features can be found in the Metadata tab.op2018.csv includes the names, artists, Spotify URIs and audio features of tracks from the Top Tracks of 2018 playlist. Descriptions of audio features are from the Spotify Web API.

This was kinda no-brainer, as it had few features. But there were some features that were related to audio part like danceability, tempo, key etc
Here I will try to explain all of them. 
First, Danceability describes how good track fits for dancing. In short it describes the positiveness that a track conveys. Tempo usually means the speed at which music is played.
